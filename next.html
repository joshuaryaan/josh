                <h2>The Design Process</h2>
                <p>A number of wireframes were considered each focusing on different aspects of the user experience (UX design). The three concepts were based around either; the current playing track (Focused), a lot of information and choice (Rich) or a small selection of upcoming options (Light). Pictured below are the two concepts &#8216;Focused&#8217; and &#8216;Rich&#8217;.</p>

            <span class="fade">

                <h4>Wireframe of the 'Focused' concept emphasising the current track.</h4>

            </span>
            <span class="fade">    
                <p>Below is the chosen wireframe, &#8216;Light&#8217;, which was most aligned with the original vision. The &#8216;Light&#8217; concept put the most emphasis on upcoming track options. Next. is designed as a tool that will disappear into the background of social settings making song selection a simple task, by displaying a selection of 4-6 songs the user has an amount of control without an overwhelming choice.</p>

            </span>
            <span class="fade">
                <p>The last step before development was to produce a render to work from. This process allows for experimentation with type and scale to find visual balance within the UI. Often changes are made on the fly while developing however starting with a high resolution render keeps the project focused and moving in the right direction.</p>

                <h2>The Development Process</h2>
                <p>As Next. is simply a prototype all that was required for development was HTML, CSS and jQuery. The two most complex parts of the project are the search functionality and the player itself. Search functionality is the only plugin used in the project (<a href="http://easyautocomplete.com/guide" alt="EasyAutocomplete" target="_blank">EasyAutocomplete</a> by &#321;ukasz Pawe&#322;czak) which suggests options of artists or track names. The result of the search is then compared to a list of options in HTML which contain custom attributes the jQuery uses to source audio files. The audio tag is hidden in favour of completely customised controls. Audio functionality is thanks to a <a href="https://blog.eduonix.com/web-programming-tutorials/learn-build-audio-player-using-html5/" alt="Audio player tutorial" target="_blank">helpful post</a> by Sabeer Shaikh for Eduonix.</p>

                <p>The fully functional <a href="https://joshuaryaan.github.io/Next./" target="_blank">prototype</a> is available for interaction. Below are a series of images displaying the functionality of the fully scalable product. The biggest learning curve for the project was the use of jQuery to manipulate or customise native HTML elements. A simple design at the outset eventually led to a few weeks of wrangling snippets of code until they worked together to create a seamless prototype.</p>
